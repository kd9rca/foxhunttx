# foxhunttx

Here's my version of an arduino based fox hunt controller.

As of now, the included featues are (in no particular order):
	1- DTMF commands
	2- Relay activated PTT
	3- Dual morse code messages
	4- Customizable speeds and times
	5- Customizable tone pattern

I also have a couple different iterations, one of which includes a way to change the morse code message via a jumper on the arduino.
I'll add it eventually too.

This was based off code and ideas from VE6BTC and WT4Y and Byonics' microfox line.
First got the idea from youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4b0fNvXA10

I'll add a schematic soon, but the neccasary info is commented in the sketch.
I'll also try to make a demo video. Stay tuned.

For now you can ignore both of the .hex files and notes.txt. Nothing useful in them.
